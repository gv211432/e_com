Concept notes for this project.

1. Authentication: This project uses the hybrid approach of authentication of jwt with sessions.
In the approact jwt tokens are stored as session secret on client machine.

2. Backend is running nodejs with express and mongoose for all api actions. There are some middlewares for facilitating the api calls. Ex auth middleware filters out all requests with invalid/unregistered sessions. Only some routes are exempted.

3. Frontend is based on ReactJs, there are many components which work together for making a whole page. Slidebar, Navbar, Footer, etc.
